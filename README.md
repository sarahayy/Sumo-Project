# Sumo-Project

## Robot Sumo
Teams will build a robot which will battle other robots in a robot sumo match.

## Objective
Be the only robot in the sumo ring at the end of the match.

## Overview
The basic idea is simple.

* Each team builds a robot, using components only from their NXT kit.
* The two robots are placed in the ring together.
* The two robots attempt to push each other out of the ring.
* The first robot to touch the floor outside the ring looses.
* If there is no winner after 3 minutes, the match is a draw.
* You may write any program to control the robot, but the robot must be autonomous, so no control via Bluetooth (or any other human interference) is permitted.

## Rules
Your Robot

* You may use any components in one EV3 kit.
* Can weigh no more than 800 g. (There will be a weigh in at the start of the tournament).
* The robot must be capable of movement, and try to move at some stage in the bout.
* If a robot is immobilized because it is on its back or side, it loses.
* You are allowed to attempt to pick up or flip over the other robot.
* Intentional damage (e.g. hammers) are not permitted. Pushing and lifting only.
* No projectiles - this is a safety hazard. Any dangerous activity means instant disqualification.
* The Ring
* The ring is a 80cm Ã— 100 cm white foam board with a circle marked in black electrical tape. There is a sample board in the basement of K17 near the lockers.
* Robots that touch the ground outside the ring lose.
* If a piece comes off a robot, and the other robot pushes that piece out of the ring, it wins.

## The Match
* Your robot will be placed in the ring with its opponent, parallel to and NOT FACING the opponent.
* The bout starts when the Run button is pressed on both robots simultaneously.
* BOTH ROBOTS MUST HOLD STILL FOR 3 SECONDS - failure to do this is an automatic disqualification.
* If no robot is pushed outside within 3 minutes, the match is a draw.
